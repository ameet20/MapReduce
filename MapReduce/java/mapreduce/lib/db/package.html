<h2>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.db Package</h2>
<p>
This package contains a library to read records from a database as an 
input to a mapreduce job, and write the output records to the database.   
</p>
<p>
The Database to access can be configured using the static methods in the 
DBConfiguration class. Jobs reading input from a database should use 
DBInputFormat#setInput() to set the configuration. And jobs writing 
its output to the database should use DBOutputFormat#setOutput().
</p>
<p> 
Tuples from/to the database are converted to/from Java objects using 
DBWritable methods. Typically, for each table in the db, a class extending
DBWritable is defined, which holds the fields of the tuple. The fields 
of a record are read from the database using DBWritable#readFields(ResultSet),
and written to the database using DBWritable#write(PreparedStatament 
statement). 
</p>
<p>
An example program using both DBInputFormat and DBOutputFormat can be found 
at src/examples/org/apache/hadoop/examples/DBCountPageview.java.
